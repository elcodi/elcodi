Elcodi is a suite of e-commerce bundles and components developed for the **Symfony2 Framework**.

It aims to promote SOLID principles, efficient code reutilization, separation of concerns as effective building blocks for the development of e-commerce applications.

Elcodi is now in an early development stage and provides a reference implementation for the basic core components found in e-commerce web projects.

See the [front-end store](http://bamboo.elcodi.com) and the [back-office](http://bamboo.elcodi.com/admin) demo application in action.
